I mostly made this for personal use, but it's just a simple boilerplate to quickly roll an app with typescript using eslint and prettier instead of tslint.

Currently using the beta 7 version of Babel for Typescript support.

## Adding a Framework

This project is just setup to use the compilers, most frameworks should simply be a drop in from there.
